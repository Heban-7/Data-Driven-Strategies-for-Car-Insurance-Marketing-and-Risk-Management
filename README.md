- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Prepare data for statistical modeling.

### Key Activities
- Data summarization and statistical description.
- Univariate analysis with advanced visualization techniques.
- Bivariate analysis to explore variable relationships.
